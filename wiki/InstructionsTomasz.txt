Tomasz, welcome to the OGame Open Source team! =)

You have been assigned on two main directions:
- Poland translation
- Redesign templates (actual pages)

Your field of interest:

1. Translation
Source tree:
    /game/
        /loca/
            /pl_pl/
There you can find all localization variables ("LOCAs") to translate.

Remember, if game engine cannot find some LOCA, it just echo "LOCA_NAME", instead its value.
So you can easily spot untranslated parts around the game.


2. Redesign
Source tree:
    /game/
        /red_css/            CSS
        /red_images/         in-game images
        /red_pages/          Page templates
        /red_scripts/        Javascript

Also there is a "junk", located here:
    /RedesignSaved/
You can use it as storage for HTML-code and redesign resources (css, images, JS)  

Interesting thread to read, before doing some redesign:
http://board.oldogame.ru/thread.php?threadid=597
(its on russian, but Google Translate should help :=)

Remember, localization variables (LOCAs) are shared between classic design and redesign.
Don't afraid to add new loca's, which wasn't present in classic Ogame.

Hook to redesign page templates is located here:
    /game/redesign.php
Its simply if/else if/else if/  to your page templates. You can also modify this file as you like.

Good luck!
